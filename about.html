        <h1 class="title">THE ORIGINS OF PLANIT YOU!</h1>
        <h4 class="info">
          The origins of Planit You and its subsequent designs came from a discussion on what to name our web application for our capstone course.
          After bouncing around a few different potential product names, Caelen came up with the idea of “Planit”, as in “Plan It”.
          Almost simultaneously, we all realized the similarity of the name “Planit” with “planet”, and thus our space-themed web planner was born.<br><br>
          At the beginning of our venture, we sought to create an original product, one that stood out from other online planners.
          After some deliberation, we decided that Planit You! would differ from others in a two main ways: aesthetics (theme > minimalism) and functionality (simplicity > complexity).<br><br>
          The several months that we worked on this project were enlightening ones.
          Allowing ourselves the opportunity to experiment, we spent quite some time solidifying our foundational knowledge while also developing completely new skills, along with troubleshooting and fixing many, <i>many</i>, mistakes.<br><br>
          It was an... interesting five months, and now we have evidence to prove it.
